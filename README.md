# my_wm_config

If you would like to set up an [i3vm](https://i3wm.org/) ish windows manager on a MacOs Computer... please read on!

I took inspirations from this lovely blog post by Christ Bargmann [So you want i3wm on MacOs?](https://cbrgm.net/so-you-want-i3wm-on-macos/). This blog will have a better explaination on how and why. Since I am not a heavy *alt* user, I *alt*ered his setup alittle bit and replaced alts with ctrls.

This repo was created to make sure I won't lose my setup haha.

## TLDR if you didn't read the blog above

Tools installed:
1. [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)
2. [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd)
3. [spacebar](https://github.com/cmacrae/spacebar)
4. [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)

Copy these config files/folders into your home folder or anywhere you'd like, and that's all.

I would also recommend installing the google chrome extension [Vimuim](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?pli=1).
