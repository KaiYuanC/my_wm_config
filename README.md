# my_wm_config

[2025-04-01] Update:
Ever since a mac update, I started having an issue with moving windows between workspaces with my yabai + skhd + spacebar setup. This seem to be a [common issue](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/1096). 

I decided  to migrate my wm to [aerospace](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide). 
And therefore storing my personal config here. I've also decided to try 'alt' keys a try. 

I have referred heavily to [Josean Martinez's guide](https://www.josean.com/posts/how-to-setup-aerospace-tiling-window-manager)

If you would like to set up an [i3vm](https://i3wm.org/) ish windows manager on a MacOs Computer... please read on!

I took inspirations from this lovely blog post by Christ Bargmann [So you want i3wm on MacOs?](https://cbrgm.net/so-you-want-i3wm-on-macos/). This blog will have a better explaination on how and why. Since I am not a heavy *alt* user, I *alt*ered his setup alittle bit and replaced alts with ctrls.

This repo was created to make sure I won't lose my setup haha.

## TLDR if you didn't read the blog above

Tools installed:
1. [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)
2. [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd)
3. [spacebar](https://github.com/cmacrae/spacebar)
4. [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)

Copy these config files/folders into your home folder or anywhere you'd like, and that's all.

I would also recommend installing the google chrome extension [Vimuim](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?pli=1).
