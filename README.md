# my_wm_config

If you would like to setup a [i3](https://i3wm.org/) like windows manager on a MacOs Computer... please read on!

I took inspiration from this lovely blog by Christ Bargmann [So you want i3wm on MacOs?](https://cbrgm.net/so-you-want-i3wm-on-macos/), it will have a better explaination. I am not a heavy *alt* user, so I altered his setup alittle bit.

This repo is generally created so I won't loss my setup, it is pain to set these hahaha.

## TLDR if you didn't read the blog above

Tools installed
1. [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)
2. [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd)
3. [spacebar](https://github.com/cmacrae/spacebar)
4. [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)

Copy these config files, and that's all.

I would also recommend installing the google chrome extension [Vimuim](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?pli=1).
